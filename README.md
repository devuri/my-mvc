# Custom MVC

In order to gain a better understanding of how the MVC framework operates. I wanted to build one from scratch.


## Setup
1. <strong>PHP 5.6 </strong>
2. <strong>Apache 2.4.\*</strong>
    * needed modules:
        * mod_rewrite
    * set AllowOverride to All
    * point the DocumentRoot to the /web directory within project
3. <strong>MySQL 5.7.20</strong>
